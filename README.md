# Code of Conduct | Startup Detroit
## Background
Why a Code of Conduct? Startup Detroit is an open source, community run project. 

Online communities include people from many different backgrounds. The Startup Detroit contributors are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of age, disability, gender, nationality, ethnicity, religion, sexuality, or similar personal characteristic.

The first goal of the Code of Conduct is to specify a baseline standard of behavior so that people with different social values and communication styles can talk about Startup Detroit effectively, productively, and respectfully.

The second goal is to provide a mechanism for resolving conflicts in the community when they arise.

The third goal of the Code of Conduct is to make our community welcoming to people from different backgrounds. Diversity is critical to the project; for Startup Detroit to be successful, it needs contributors and users from all backgrounds.

## **Where does this apply?**

* The official [GitHub organization](https://github.com/startupdetroit); all pull requests, issues and comments.

* The [Startup Detroit Slack](https://startupdetroit.slack.com) community. For an invite to this Slack, [click here](https://startupdetroit.herokuapp.com/).

Startup Detroit meetups and other related groups are encouraged to adopt this Code of Conduct.

## **Values**

These are the values to which people in the Startup Detroit community should aspire.

* Be friendly and welcoming

* Be patient

    * Remember that people have varying communication styles and that not everyone is using their native language (meaning and tone can be lost in translation).

* Be thoughtful

    * Productive communication requires effort. Think about how your words will be interpreted.

    * Remember that sometimes it is best to refrain entirely from commenting.

* Be respectful

    * In particular, respect differences of opinion.

* Be charitable

    * Interpret the arguments of others in good faith, do not seek to disagree. - When we do disagree, try to understand why.

* Avoid destructive behavior:

    * Derailing: stay on topic; if you want to talk about something else, start a new conversation.

    * Unconstructive criticism: don't merely condemn the current state of affairs; offer—or at least solicit—suggestions as to how things may be improved.

    * Snarking (pithy, unproductive, sniping comments)

    * Discussing potentially offensive or sensitive issues; this all too often leads to unnecessary conflict.

    * Microaggressions: brief and commonplace verbal, behavioral, and environmental indignities that communicate hostile, derogatory or negative slights and insults to a person or group.

People are complicated. You should expect to be misunderstood and to misunderstand others; when this inevitably occurs, resist the urge to be defensive or assign blame. Try not to take offense where no offense was intended. Give people the benefit of the doubt. Even if the intent was to provoke, do not rise to it. It is the responsibility of *all parties* to de-escalate conflict when it arises.

## **Unwelcome behavior**

These actions are explicitly forbidden in Startup Detroit spaces:

* Insulting, demeaning, hateful, or threatening remarks.

* Discrimination based on age, disability, gender, nationality, race, religion, sexuality, or similar personal characteristic.

* Bullying or systematic harassment.

* Unwelcome sexual advances.

* Provoking any of these.

## **Moderation**

When you participate in areas where the code of conduct applies, you should act in the spirit of the values above. If you conduct yourself in a way that is explicitly forbidden by the Code of Conduct, you will be warned and asked to stop. If you do not stop, you will be removed from our community spaces temporarily. Repeated, willful breaches of the Code of Conduct will result in a permanent ban.

As Startup Detroit is an open source approach to building the Detroit Startup community, we rely on community members to actively follow the Code of Conduct and point out violations. 

Moderators are chosen based on involvement and active interest in the community. If you would like to be a moderator, join the Slack and message one of the current moderators @ted or @shriyash. 
As the community grows, elections will be held to nominate new moderators.
